	In feature folder there are cucumber features with tests, in root folder rspec template without implementation (could be look like this or could be improved using shared examples and shared context).

	Cucumber features doesn't cover cases with big numbers and with empty fields which crashing application.

	Also there as example Scenario Outline which could be run instead of all tests in same feature file.

	In allure report you could find all necessary information about tests including screenshot.
